# QUT CAB 230 Assignment 2 Tests

## Here we provide the test suite that will be used in assessing your server.

To run the tests, first install the dependencies, then make sure that your server is running (by default we test localhost:3000, however you can change the URL if you are testing a server hosted on a VM or if you're not using port 3000)

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

## After each test

A `report.html` file will be generated, which will give you a good idea of how your server is behaving, ideally you'd want to see all tests passed. The html won't give you the exact error message, you can either look into the console responses, or hit the endpoint with postman to debug.
